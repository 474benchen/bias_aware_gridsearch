# biased_gridsearch: Enhanced GridSearchCV for Bias and Accuracy Optimization

## Introduction
This repository introduces a novel variation of the `GridSearchCV` algorithm from `scikit-learn`, uniquely designed to optimize machine learning models not only for accuracy but also for fairness metrics. This project addresses the critical need for unbiased models in machine learning, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, recidivism prediction, mortgage lending, and income-based financial decisions.

## Features
- **Enhanced GridSearch Algorithm**: Extends `sklearn`'s `GridSearchCV` to evaluate and optimize both accuracy and bias metrics simultaneously.
- **Bias Metrics Integration**: Incorporates key bias metrics like demographic parity, equalized odds, and others, ensuring models are fair and equitable.
- **Domain-Specific Applications**: Provides practical implementations in four critical domains:
  - Healthcare: Improving diagnostic fairness.
  - Recidivism: Ensuring unbiased risk assessments.
  - Mortgage: Facilitating fair lending practices.
  - Finance: Promoting equity in income-related decisions.

## Installation


## Examples
This section provides examples of how to apply the Enhanced GridSearchCV in each of the four domains. Please refer to the respective folders for detailed notebooks:
