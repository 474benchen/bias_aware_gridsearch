# Documentation

Along with bias aware gridsearchCV (BAGS), our work includes 2 helper functions that work to represent 
the framework for natural extensions to our progress so far. These 2 functions calculate different 
bias metrics and are plugged into BAGS as its primary bias consideration. As such, documentation 
is split into 2 sections - 1 for BAGS methods, the other for the provided bias calculation functions.
