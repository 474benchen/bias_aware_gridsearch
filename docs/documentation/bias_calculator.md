# Bias Statistic Functions

A necessary part of considering bias is providing functions that can calculate such metrics. As part of our work, 
we have provided 2 functions for this: disparate impact and statistical parity. These functions serve more as an example - 
custom made functions can easily be made to substitute as long as they follow the key criteria of <b>the value for 
a fair outcome must be 0</b>.
