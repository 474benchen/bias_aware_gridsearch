# About BiasAwareGridSearchCV

BiasAwareGridSearchCV is a Python tool created to address a critical need in machine learning: reducing bias. Developed as an extension of scikit-learn, this package helps data professionals build fairer machine learning models by integrating bias into the classical machine learning workflow. It's designed for situations where decisions could be influenced by factors like gender or race, and where it's crucial to ensure these decisions are as unbiased as possible.

Our tool stands out by not only measuring model performance in terms of accuracy but also considering how fair a model is. With BiasAwareGridSearchCV, you can evaluate and select models based on both their accuracy and their level of bias.

The package is user-friendly and fits smoothly into standard machine learning workflows. It offers functionalities for tuning model parameters with a keen eye on fairness, alongside traditional performance metrics. Plus, it includes visualization features for a clearer understanding of the trade-offs between accuracy and bias.

In short, BiasAwareGridSearchCV is our effort to ensure that AI and machine learning contribute positively and fairly to our society, providing tools that help mitigate bias in automated decision-making.

{: .note } 
This work runs adjacent to existing bias mitigation techniques - it is presented as a novel step to the pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing steps that already exist.
